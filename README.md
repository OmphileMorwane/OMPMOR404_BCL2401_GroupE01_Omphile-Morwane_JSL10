# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

## Objectives:
The objective of the project was to create an interactive web application that simulates solving a series of challenges demonstrating the use of asynchronous JavaScript functions, fetching data from an API, and manipulating the DOM based on fetched data. Each room represented a different puzzle related to programming concepts. 

## Reflections:
Throughout the project, I encountered difficulties managing asynchronous operations and maintaining seamless data flow across various components of the application. Nonetheless, addressing these obstacles has deepened my comprehension of asynchronous programming and data manipulation techniques in JavaScript.


## Challenges faced:
One of the main challenges I faced was debugging asynchronous code and handling errors effectively. I also faced syntax error when running the code.

## Areas for Improvement:
-Refactoring the code to enhance its readability and maintainability, ensuring that it remains easy to understand and modify in the future. 
 
-Exploring optimization techniques to improve the performance of data fetching and processing operations will help ensure that the application runs smoothly and efficiently, even with large amounts of data.

-Improving my attention to detail to minimize future syntax errors.

## Overall learning experience:
Working on this project was a valuable learning experience. It provided hands-on practice with various JavaScript concepts, including asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and error handling. Additionally, it allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and gain insights into building interactive web applications.
